A "snippet" is a markdown text entry in the system. Each snippet belongs to exactly one week 
i.e. a date range of duration one week where the week starts on Monday. 
A snippet can be modified any number of times.

A "week" is defined as 7 days starting from Monday and ending on following Sunday.


The date range should work as the following
- By default the date range should be Monday of the current week-4 weeks, and Sunday of current week
- User can select both start and end dates as required. end date should always be greater than start date
- Start date must always be a Monday. End date must always be a Sunday.
- The universe they select will comprise of weeks which are FULLY included in that range. No partial weeks are there by design.
- If universe of weeks selected by date ranges above contains some weeks for which there is no data,
either in the past or in the future, the "snippet content" should show "Add snippets" button. 
Clicking on this add snippet button should open up a snippet input area which is where user will enter the snippets
- snippets should be displayed in reverse chronological order i.e. latest week first
